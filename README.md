## 0 to 60 with AWS AppSync: Rapid Development Techniques for Mobile APIs

This project accompanies the AWS re:Invent 2018 Chalk Talk session of the same name.

In this project, we "prototype" a mobile API using [AWS AppSync](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/) to demonstrate the flexibility and benefits of AppSync and GraphQL for rapid development. Our prototype is in support of a new mobile app for ElastiLodge, a chain of boutique hotels. In conjunction with app design, our team will build the associated API across three phases of work:

1. Expose a legacy REST API (represented by API Gateway and Lambda here).
2. Enhance the legacy data to include a new, machine learning-driven pricing API (also represented by API Gateway and Lambda).
3. Implement a prototype of the reservation booking API.
4. Build an iOS application as client of the API.
